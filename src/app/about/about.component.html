          Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web.
          Angular combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling,
          and integrated best practices to solve development challenges.
          Angular empowers developers to build applications that live on the web,
          mobile, or the desktop

          TypeScript is a free and open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language. Anders Hejlsberg, lead architect of C# and creator of Delphi and Turbo Pascal, has worked on the development of TypeScript.
          TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for client-side or server-side (Node.js) execution.
          TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and compiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.
